                        Lucky Shrub was started by a husband and wife team, Jason and Maria, who share a long-time love
                        for plants. Jason is
                        the
                        garden architect. He creates and oversees all designs while managing his team of landscapers.
                        Maria manages all the
                        marketing for the company and oversees the nursery.

                        We have recently expanded our collection to include a variety of air plants. These unique plants
                        don't require soil to
                        grow and can be displayed in creative ways, such as hanging terrariums or mounted on driftwood.
                        Air plants are known for
                        their low maintenance requirements and can add a touch of elegance to any space.
